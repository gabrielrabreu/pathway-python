# Control Structures in Python

# Control structures are fundamental in programming and allow you to control the flow of your code.
# In Python, you'll commonly use conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for and while).

# Conditional Statements (if-else)

# The 'if' statement allows you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met.
if_condition = True
if if_condition:
  print("condition is true")
  # Code to execute if the condition is True
# You can also use 'else' to execute a different block of code when the condition is False.
else:
  print("condition is false")
   # Code to execute if the condition is False

# Here's an example:
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 10")
