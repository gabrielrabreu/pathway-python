# Python Control Structures

This section covers control structures in Python, which are essential for controlling the flow of your code. Python provides conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for and while) to handle decision-making and repetition.

## Contents

- [Control Structures Overview](README.md): An introduction to control structures in Python.

- [Loops (for and while)](loops.py): Practical examples of for and while loops.

## Control Structures Overview

Control structures are used to manage the execution flow of your Python code. In this section, you'll learn about two fundamental control structures:

- **Conditional Statements (if-else)**: These statements allow you to execute code conditionally based on whether a specific condition is met.

- **Loops (for and while)**: Loops are used for repetitive tasks, enabling you to execute the same block of code multiple times.

Please refer to the specific files in this section for detailed examples and demonstrations.
