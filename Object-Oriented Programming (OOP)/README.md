# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Welcome to the "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python" section of this repository. This section is dedicated to exploring the principles and concepts of object-oriented programming using Python.

## Overview

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. Python is an object-oriented programming language, and this section will help you understand its OOP features.
