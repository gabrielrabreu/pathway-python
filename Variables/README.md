## Python Variable Naming Convention

When working with variables in Python, it's essential to follow a consistent naming convention for clarity and maintainability. Here are the key guidelines:

1. Use lowercase letters: Variable names should be in all lowercase letters.

2. Separate words with underscores: Use underscores (_) to separate words in variable names for better readability. For example, `user_name` is preferred over `username`.

3. Be descriptive: Choose meaningful and descriptive variable names that indicate their purpose. For instance, `counter` is better than `c`.

4. Follow PEP 8: Adhere to the [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code, which includes recommendations for variable naming.

Please refer to the specific files in this section, especially [variable_assignment.py](variable_assignment.py), for practical examples of variable assignment while following these naming conventions.
