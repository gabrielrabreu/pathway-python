# Python Sets

This section focuses on Python sets, which are versatile data structures used to store unique and unordered elements. Sets are useful for performing operations on collections of distinct values.

## Set Overview

Sets in Python are used to store unique and unordered elements. They are particularly useful when you need to work with collections of distinct values without duplicates.

## Set Operations

In this section, we will explore various set operations:

- **Creating Sets**: Create sets and add unique elements to them.
- **Adding Elements**: Learn how to add elements to a set.
- **Removing Elements**: Understand how to remove elements from a set.
- **Set Methods**: Explore set-specific methods such as `len()`, `remove()`, and `discard()`.

Please refer to the [set_operations.py](set_operations.py) file for practical examples and demonstrations of these set operations.

Understanding how to work with sets is valuable when dealing with collections of unique values in Python.
