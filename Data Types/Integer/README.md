## Integer Overview

Integers in Python are used to represent whole numbers, both positive and negative. They are essential for performing arithmetic calculations in Python.

## Integer Operations

In this section, we will explore various integer operations:

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, modulus, and exponentiation.

- **Creating Integers**: Create integer variables and assign values to them.

Please refer to the [integers_operations.py](integers_operations.py) file for practical examples and demonstrations of these integer operations.

Understanding how to work with integers is crucial for mathematical calculations and data manipulation in Python.
