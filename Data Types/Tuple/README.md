# Python Tuples

This section focuses on Python tuples, which are ordered collections of items. Unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are useful for representing fixed collections of data.

- [Tuple Operations](tuple_operations.py): Examples and explanations of common tuple operations.

## Tuple Overview

Tuples in Python are similar to lists but with the key difference that they are immutable. Once you create a tuple, its elements cannot be modified. This immutability makes tuples suitable for representing fixed data structures.

## Tuple Operations

In this section, we will explore various tuple operations:

- **Creating Tuples**: Create tuples and assign values to them.
- **Accessing Elements**: Access elements by their index using indexing and slicing.
- **Tuple Methods**: Learn about tuple-specific methods such as `len()`, `count()`, and `index()`.

Please refer to the [tuple_operations.py](tuple_operations.py) file for practical examples and demonstrations of these tuple operations.

Understanding how to work with tuples is important when you need to store data that should not change during program execution.
