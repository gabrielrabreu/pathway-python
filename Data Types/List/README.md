# Python Lists

This section focuses on Python lists, which are used to store ordered collections of items. Lists are versatile and allow for various operations, including adding, removing, and manipulating elements.

## List Overview

Lists in Python are ordered collections of items. They are defined using square brackets `[]` and can contain elements of different data types. Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their content.

## List Operations

In this section, we will explore various list operations:

- **Adding Elements**:
  - Append: `my_list.append(item)` adds an item to the end of the list.
  - Insert: `my_list.insert(index, item)` inserts an item at a specific index.
  - Extend: `my_list.extend(iterable)` adds elements from an iterable to the list.

- **Removing Elements**:
  - Remove: `my_list.remove(item)` removes the first occurrence of an item.
  - Pop: `my_list.pop(index)` removes and returns an item at a specific index.
  - Delete: `del my_list[index]` deletes an item at a specific index.
  - Clear: `my_list.clear()` removes all items from the list.

- **Common List Operations**:
  - Length: `len(my_list)` returns the number of items in the list.
  - Index: `my_list.index(item)` returns the index of the first occurrence of an item.
  - Count: `my_list.count(item)` returns the number of times an item appears.
  - Sort: `my_list.sort()` sorts the list in ascending order.
  - Reverse: `my_list.reverse()` reverses the order of elements.

Please refer to the [lists_operations.py](lists_operations.py) file for practical examples and demonstrations of these list operations.

Understanding lists and their operations is fundamental for working with collections of data in Python.
