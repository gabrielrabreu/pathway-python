# Boolean Operations in Python

# Booleans are fundamental data types in Python used to represent True or False values. Here are some common boolean operations:

# Creating boolean variables
is_true = True
is_false = False

# Comparison Operators

# Equal to: Check if two values are equal
equal_result = (3 == 3)
# Result: True

# Not equal to: Check if two values are not equal
not_equal_result = (3 != 4)
# Result: True

# Greater than: Check if one value is greater than another
greater_than_result = (5 > 3)
# Result: True

# Less than: Check if one value is less than another
less_than_result = (2 < 4)
# Result: True

# Greater than or equal to: Check if one value is greater than or equal to another
greater_than_or_equal_result = (5 >= 5)
# Result: True

# Less than or equal to: Check if one value is less than or equal to another
less_than_or_equal_result = (2 <= 4)
# Result: True

# Logical Operators

# AND: Check if both conditions are true
and_result = (True and True)
# Result: True

# OR: Check if at least one condition is true
or_result = (True or False)
# Result: True

# NOT: Invert the boolean value
not_result = not True
# Result: False

# Boolean operations are used for making decisions and controlling the flow of your code in Python.
