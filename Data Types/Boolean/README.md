# Python Booleans

This section focuses on Python booleans, which are used to represent True or False values. Booleans play a crucial role in making decisions and controlling program flow.

## Contents

- [Boolean Overview](README.md): An introduction to Python booleans.
- [Boolean Operations](boolean_operations.py): Examples and explanations of common boolean operations.

## Boolean Overview

Booleans in Python are used to represent binary states, where something can be either true or false. They are fundamental for decision-making and conditional statements.

## Boolean Operations

In this section, we will explore various boolean operations:

- **Comparison Operators**: Perform comparisons using operators like equal to (`==`), not equal to (`!=`), greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), and less than or equal to (`<=`).

- **Logical Operators**: Combine boolean values using logical operators like AND (`and`), OR (`or`), and NOT (`not`).

Please refer to the [boolean_operations.py](boolean_operations.py) file for practical examples and demonstrations of these boolean operations.

Understanding how to work with boolean values is essential for decision-making and controlling the flow of your Python code.
