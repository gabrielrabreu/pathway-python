# Float Operations in Python

# Floats are fundamental data types in Python used to represent decimal numbers. Here are some common float operations:

# Creating floats
float1 = 3.14
float2 = 2.0

# Arithmetic Operations

# Addition: Add two floats
addition_result = float1 + float2
# Result: 5.14

# Subtraction: Subtract one float from another
subtraction_result = float1 - float2
# Result: 1.14

# Multiplication: Multiply two floats
multiplication_result = float1 * float2
# Result: 6.28

# Division: Divide one float by another
division_result = float1 / float2
# Result: 1.57

# Exponentiation: Calculate the power of a float
exponentiation_result = float1 ** 2
# Result: 9.8596
