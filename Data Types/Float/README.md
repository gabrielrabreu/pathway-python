- [Float Operations](float_operations.py): Examples and explanations of common float operations.

## Float Overview

Floats in Python are used to represent decimal numbers, and they are crucial for performing calculations involving non-integer values.

## Float Operations

In this section, we will explore various float operations:

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation with float numbers.

- **Creating Floats**: Create float variables and assign values to them.

Please refer to the [float_operations.py](float_operations.py) file for practical examples and demonstrations of these float operations.

Understanding how to work with float numbers is important for handling decimal values and performing accurate mathematical calculations in Python.
