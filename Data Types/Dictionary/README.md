# Python Dictionaries

This section focuses on Python dictionaries, which are versatile data structures used to store key-value pairs. Dictionaries are essential for organizing and accessing data using unique keys.

## Dictionary Overview

Dictionaries in Python are used to store data in the form of key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and it is used to access the corresponding value. Dictionaries are a fundamental data structure for managing structured data.

## Dictionary Operations

In this section, we will explore various dictionary operations:

- **Creating Dictionaries**: Create dictionaries and assign key-value pairs.
- **Accessing Elements**: Access values by their keys.
- **Dictionary Methods**: Learn about dictionary-specific methods such as `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()`.

Please refer to the [dictionary_operations.py](dictionary_operations.py) file for practical examples and demonstrations of these dictionary operations.

Understanding how to work with dictionaries is crucial for organizing and accessing structured data in Python.
