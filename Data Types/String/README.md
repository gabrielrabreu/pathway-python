## String Overview

Strings in Python are sequences of characters, and they are used to represent text data. Python provides a rich set of operations and methods for working with strings.

## String Operations

In this section, we will explore various string operations:

- **Length**: Get the length of a string using `len(my_string)`.

- **Accessing Characters**: Access individual characters in the string using indexing (e.g., `my_string[0]`).

- **Slicing**: Extract substrings using slicing (e.g., `my_string[7:13]`).

- **Concatenation**: Combine two or more strings using the `+` operator.

- **Repetition**: Repeat a string using the `*` operator.

- **String Methods**: Utilize string methods like `upper()`, `lower()`, `replace()`, `split()`, `join()`, and more for string manipulation.

- **String Formatting**: Use f-strings (Python 3.6+) for string formatting.

Please refer to the [strings_operations.py](strings_operations.py) file for practical examples and demonstrations of these string operations.

Understanding how to work with strings is crucial for handling text data effectively in Python.
