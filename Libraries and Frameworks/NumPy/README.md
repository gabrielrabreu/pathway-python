# NumPy in Python

This section explores the NumPy library in Python, which is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Overview

NumPy is an essential library for data manipulation, scientific computing, and machine learning in Python. It offers a high-performance multidimensional array object (NumPy array) and tools for working with these arrays.
